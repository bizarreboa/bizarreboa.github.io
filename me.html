								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/friends.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>My parents immigrated to America to build a life and family together that would see more fortune and opportunity than they had grown up with in post-Cultural Revolution Shanghai.
								After getting their professional degrees in Florida, they drove up to New York and settled down. I was born not long after, and my little brother joined me in life nearly six years later.</p>
								<p>I was born and raised in Westchester, New York, but my family moved to Taiwan just as I was about to start high school. My Mandarin wasn't the best, since my parents only spoke Shanghainese
								and some English at home, but I made do at my new (international) school, IBSH.</p>
								<p>In January of 2020, I came back to the U.S. to attend Case Western Reserve University for my undergraduate degree. This, it turned out, was not a good time to be in the U.S. away from my
								family, and I flew back to Taiwan shortly after spring break due to the pandemic. Thus, my college experience was remote half the time, 13 hours displaced from campus.This was great, actually. 
								Taiwan weathered the pandemic extremely well in the first year, and I had a blast hanging out with my high school friends at Louisa (a popular Taiwanese cafe) to work on homework and study.</p>
								<p>After earning a B.S. in Math and Physics and a minor in Astronomy, I now attend Northwestern as a graduate student pursuing my PhD in Astronomy, working with Professor Wen-fai Fong on
								Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host galaxies.</p>
